# Maximum Happy Set problem (MaxHS)
For an undirected graph G = (V, E) and a subset S ⊆ V of vertices, a vertex
v is happy if v and all its neighbors are in S; otherwise unhappy. Given an
undirected graph G = (V, E) and an integer k, the goal of MaxHS is to find a
subset S ⊆V of k vertices such that the number of happy vertices is maximized.
